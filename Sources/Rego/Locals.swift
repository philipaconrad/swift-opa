/// Array-based storage for IR local variables.
///
/// # Implementation Assumptions
///
/// This implementation makes the following assumptions about how the IR planner allocates locals:
///
/// 1. **Not Sparse**: The planner allocates locals with indices starting from 0 and
///    generally increasing consecutively. While gaps may exist, locals are not sparse
///    (e.g., using indices 0, 1, and 1000000). This makes array-based storage efficient
///    compared to dictionary-based storage.
///
/// 2. **Stable During Execution**: Local indices don't change during policy evaluation.
///    The same index always refers to the same logical variable.
///
/// 3. **No Register Collision**: Functions don't overwrite each other's locals. Each function
///    call frame uses its own set of local indices, so values don't need to be saved and
///    restored across function calls.
///
/// ## Growth Strategy
///
/// The array grows automatically when accessing out-of-bounds indices via the subscript setter.
/// After initial growth during the first few statements, the array typically reaches a stable
/// size and requires no further allocation for the remainder of evaluation.
///
/// ## Future Improvement
///
/// These assumptions could be validated during the `prepare` phase if violations lead
/// to incorrect behavior or excessive memory usage.
